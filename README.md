# LaTeX source for my CV.

This is a source for the academic CV I keep on my
[website](https://www.bochkarev.io) --- see the [.tex](./Bochkarev_CV.tex) file.
It is mostly designed from scratch, and this is on purpose. I looked through
several templates to get some inspiration, but in the end of the day I find it
easier to keep the document lean and implement the features I need, rather than
to use an existing template and learn a whole new domain-specific language for
creating CVs.

I hope this repo illustrates the fact that designing even relatively non-trivial
layout is not that difficult in LaTeX given the packages we have.

The repository also contains the following alternative versions (not necessarily
up to date):

- A one-page document ("industrial" CV): see
  [.tex](./industry_versions/2021-09-25%20One-pager/Bochkarev_CV.tex),
  [.pdf](./industry_versions/2021-09-25%20One-pager/Bochkarev_CV.pdf)
- "Lebenslauf" edition (more focused on chronology and facts): see
  [.tex](./Lebenslauf/Bochkarev_Lebenslauf.tex),
  [.pdf](./Lebenslauf/Bochkarev_Lebenslauf.pdf)
