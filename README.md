# LaTeX source for my CV.

This is a source for the academic CV I keep on my
[website](https://www.bochkarev.io) --- see the `.tex` file. It is mostly
designed from scratch, and this is on purpose. I looked through several
templates to get some inspiration, but in the end of the day I find it easier to
keep the document lean and implement the features I need, rather than to use an
existing template and learn a whole new domain-specific language for creating CVs.

I hope this repo illustrates the fact that designing even relatively non-trivial
layout is not that difficult in LaTeX given the packages we have.

Feel free to [ping](https://www.bochkarev.io/contact) me if you have any questions / notes / suggestions.
